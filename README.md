# githisstry
just a small tool to track git commit history of a project, it shows the commiter name, commit time and commit message

## How to install and use

<p>Install node if you dont have it already installed, go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node installation documentation</a></p>
<p>

Clone the repo or download the repo

## Build Setup

make sure you are in the project directory

# install dependencies
run <b>npm run install</b> command

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
run <b>npm run dev</b> command

# using the frontend tool
go the any browser and type http://localhost:3000/ and run it

The tool can be use to get commit info on any public repo

input the username of the repo(owner username) e.g google

input the repo name e.g googletest

the results will show below the form, currently no pagination implemented, so you have to scroll down to get all info

# error when searching for data 

when you get the 404 error, it means the username or repo name you provided are wrong

# Thanks .............
